# InvestChest

## Overview

InvestChest was completed as apart of the Winter 2020 assessment for the New York Tech Talent Pipeline. The given instructions were to build a fullstack web-based stock profolio application where users can purchase stock based on values fetched from a third-party API. 
The specifics of the functionality for the app (user registration/signin/purchase forms, portfolio and transaction page, etc.) were given ahead of time, but there was freedom select the technologies one viewed best fit for the task. There were also rough design and styling guidelines given with the instructions (including the wireframe mockups included below).
